# ProgrammingAssignment3

## Repository for third programming assignment. Coursera R Programming course. Week 4.

The assignment consists in creating 3 function find specific hospitals based on specific rankings on specific "quality parameters" from a given (messy-ish) dataset.
I managed to use only R base functions. No data handling libraries (e.g. dplyr) have been used. 
That makes the code longer than what it could be and took a bit more time than expected. Anyway, it works.
